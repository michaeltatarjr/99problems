# 99problems
I've got 99 problems...and SQL is the solution all of them!

This is an ongoing study of SQL problems, just as a simple way to keep my SQL skills sharp.  I use SQL occasionally in other professional avenues, but it's not enough to know it when I need to actually use it.  These are problems that I've solved from different code spaces, such as Strata Scratch, CodeWars, etc.
